# Project README
## About the Project

This project is a community platform designed to make recycling, reusing, and sustainable living easier for everyone. It brings together three major parts of daily life—waste management, community connection, and environmental action—and puts them into one simple experience.

Users can discover nearby recycling points, classify waste using AI, give away unused items, join local events, and earn rewards for making eco-friendly choices. The goal is to help people reduce waste, support circular economy habits, and create active, environmentally conscious communities.

## What You Can Do With the Platform

### 1. Understand Your Waste

Not sure if something is plastic, metal, textile, or organic waste?
The platform includes a built-in waste classifier powered by TensorFlow Lite.
It works directly on the user’s device, even without internet.

Just point the camera at an item, and it tells you:

- What material it is
- How it should be disposed of
- Where the nearest suitable recycling point is

### 2. Find Recycling Points Anywhere

The platform features an interactive map powered by Google Maps, showing:

- Recycling centers
- Drop-off points
- Donation centers
- Bulky waste locations
- Textile, glass, paper, electronics recycling points
- User-added locations from the community

Users can open the map, filter by category (e.g., only glass or textiles), and discover where to drop items responsibly—whether they are at home or traveling in another country.

### 3. Share & Reuse Items

Instead of throwing things away, users can create posts to:

- Give away items
- Share reusable goods
- Offer or request materials
- Upload images and add descriptions

This encourages reuse, reduces landfill waste, and helps people connect with others who may need what they no longer use.

### 4. Join or Organize Community Events

The platform supports community-driven events such as:

- Local clean-up drives
- Recycling workshops
- Clothing swaps
- Donation campaigns
- Meetups for eco-enthusiasts

Anyone can create an event, invite others, and track attendance.
Participants get recognition and can meet people who care about sustainability.

### 5. Discover Useful Locations

Apart from recycling points, users can also find:

- Warehouses
- Distribution centers
- Donation collection sites
- User check-in points

Every location includes details such as address, coordinates, and additional info.

### 6. Earn Points, Badges & Recognition

To make sustainable living more engaging, the platform includes a reward system:

- Users collect points for recycling, posting items, attending events, and more.
- They also earn badges for achievements such as:
  - Recycling certain categories
  - Participating regularly
  - Helping others in the community

Users can track their progress, view their badge collection, and see how their contributions make a difference.

## Why This Platform Matters

Modern recycling systems are often confusing, scattered, and hard to navigate.
People want to live more sustainably, but they don’t always know:

- What kind of waste they have
- Where to take it
- Who else is trying to make a difference
- How to keep reusable items in circulation

This platform solves these problems by combining:

- AI waste detection
- A global map of recycling locations
- A community for sharing items and organizing events
- Gamified rewards that encourage long-term habits

It makes sustainable living accessible, fun, and community-driven.

## Who Is This For?

- Anyone trying to recycle properly
- People who want to donate or give away unused items
- Communities looking to organize green events
- Environmentally conscious users who want to track their impact
- Cities or universities aiming to improve local recycling participation
- Travelers who need to find recycling points abroad

## The Vision

This project aims to build a future where:

- Recycling is simple
- Waste is reduced
- Reuse is the norm
- Communities work together
- Technology empowers sustainability

With AI assistance, global maps, social tools, and a reward system, the platform creates a complete ecosystem for improving environmental habits and encouraging collective action.
